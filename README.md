# # House_price_prediction

# Step 1: Import Libraries and Load the Dataset
Import necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
Load the Boston Housing Prices dataset into DataFrames for data and target values.
# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Check for missing values in the dataset.
Explore data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
# Step 3: Feature Selection (if needed)
Use correlation analysis or feature importance scores to select relevant features for the model.
# Step 4: Build the Linear Regression Model
Create a Linear Regression model.
Fit the model to the training data.
Make predictions on the test data.
Calculate evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R^2 score.
# Step 5: Evaluate Model Performance
Calculate evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy.
Visualize predicted prices vs. actual prices using scatter plots.
Analyze residual plots for patterns or heteroscedasticity.
# Step 6: Interpret the Model
Analyze the coefficients to understand feature impact on house prices.
Draw insights from the model's performance and interpretation.
Consider feature importance, unexpected results, and fit quality.
